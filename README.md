# Oracle Job Assignment

Introduction:

            This was the project assigned by Oracle Inc., USA for the position of Senior Product Manager for its product Oracle Marketing Cloud for its Bangalore, India operations. I got selected for the position after around 9 rounds/levels of interviews and assessments but to my dismay, had to stick to my then current employer and could not join Oracle.
            
            So this is the project that I delivered to the technical team (OMC HOD/Product Owner).

Assignment took around 5 hours to implement E2E functionality.

N.B.: Unfortunately I could not do a lot of streamlining of the code due to my strict schedule and business commitments. There is still a good scope of improvement could be done to this project.


Thank you.
