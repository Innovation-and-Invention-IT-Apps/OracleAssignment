# OracleAssignment

Assignment took around 5 hours to implement E2E functionality.

DESCRIPTION:
APIs Used:  Jersey API for RESTful WebService implementation. (OSS License
            Jackson API for JSON processing/binding to Java objects. (ASL/OSS Apache License)
            Hibernate for Persistence layer. (OSS License)
            MySQL Server for RDBMS. (Community Server License)
            Tomcat 8 for hosting the web module. (OSS License)
            Eclipse Luna for development. (OSS License)
            JDK 8 for building. (OSS License)


Instructions for Development:
            1. Download and Install:-
                  a. JDK 8
                  b. eclipse Luna - J2EE edition
                  c. MySQL Server
                  d. Tomcat 8
                  
            2. Download the codebase (eclipse project).
            
            3. Import the project into eclipse workspace.
            
            4. Configure Tomcat Server.
            
            5. Configure MySQL Server as:
                  a. Use default port 3306.
                  b. Use password "root" for user id "root".
                  c. Create Database "restserver".
                  d. Create Table "oracle_assignment".
                        Please use the DDL Script file "MySQL_DDL_restservice.oracle_assignment.txt" provided at path "OracleAssignment/information/".
            
            6. Export the web project as WAR file.
            
            7. Deploy the Web Application Archive on Tomcat Server.
            
            8. Now you may use the following URL for doing all operations as needed.
                  Base URL: 
            
            9. On the otherhand you can use the "Postman REST Client" config provided in the file "OracleAssignment/information/Postman REST Client Collection.json".
                  a. Install the REST client on Google Chrome browser.
                  b. Import the file into your tool.
                  c. You can now see the required actions on your left hand section.
                  d. Now you can start testing.
                  


N.B.: Unfortunately I could not do a lot of streamlining of the code due to my strict schedule and business commitments. There is still a good scope of improvement could be done to this project.


Thank you.
